    <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>These sliders really taste like pizza (as they should) but with a hint of sweetness from the Hawaiian rolls. Trying to separate them can get messy but they are absolutely delicious.</p>
 <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
 <ul>
     <li>Cooking spray</li>
     <li>Mozzarella</li>
     <li>Black peppper</li>
     <li>Tomato sauce</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Steps:</h2>
 <ol>
     <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment, and place a cooling rack on baking sheet. Spray rack with cooking spray.</li>
     <li>Stir together mozzarella, Italian cheese blend, basil, pepper, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Italian seasoning in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.</li>
     <li>Stir together pizza sauce and pesto in another small bowl. Set aside.</li>
     <li>Without separating the individual rolls, cut the entire slab of rolls in half horizontally using a serrated knife. Place bottom layer of rolls on the prepared baking sheet. Set top layer of rolls aside.</li>
     <li>Sprinkle bottom layer of rolls evenly with half of the cheese mixture; top evenly with half of pepperoni and half of the sauce. Repeat layers once.</li>
     <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 15 minutes.</li>
 </ol>
